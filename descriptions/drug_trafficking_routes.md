Drug trafficking is an enormous, international industry that operates right under our noses. This resource focuses on analyzing this hidden industry and the role of each country in it, using drug seizure data from the United Nations Office On Drugs and Crime (UNODC). To understand the magnitude of the industry, a recent UN report stated that "the global drug trade generated an estimated 321.6 billion in 2003." Despite the wide variety of drugs, the 3 most heavily trafficked are Cannabis, Heroin, and Cocaine, and vastly different circumstances surround each one; this resource focuses on analyzing those drugs most heavily.

The map above visualizes how drugs move across the world, and one is able to choose whether to view Cannabis, Heroin, or Cocaine data, as well as a region. The region option shows the routes for imports and exports for that region.
