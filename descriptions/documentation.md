### Where did we start?

Our raw data came from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's data on significant seizures whose website is here: https://data.unodc.org/

The data set contains various observations on the drug seized, date seized, amount, destination country, producing country, and more. We significantly filtered the data set in order to more effectively analyze the data.

### Why do we care?

Drug trafficking is a massive hidden industry that accounts for an estimated 1% of global trade. Analysis of this trade can be extremely useful for law enforcement as they try to stifle drug trafficking and combat drug addiction.

### Where can I find your code?

All of it can be found in this github repository: https://github.com/lukasg33/drugs-visualization
